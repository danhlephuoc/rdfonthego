\title{Plan for implementation of smart office in DERI building}
\maketitle
\section{Description of work}
We are trying to build a small smart space in DERI, which helps people easier to communicate with each others and with the building.There are two main aims we are trying to implement in this project:\\
1) To build a small smart environment where devices are able to communicate each other.\\
2) Integrate data from sensor network with some services in DERI to build some smart services with could be helpful for people in DERI.\\
On the technique side the project can show how the devices can communicate each other, how to build a small sensor network, and how to using sensor network data to do some smart services for office.
\section{Scenarios}
\subsection{Meeting room management: }
 With noise sensor are placed in a meeting room, system can detect if this meeting room is busy. Integrating with meeting room booking data in DERI, the system can learn that if the room has been booked. The system will notify people in this room through their personal devices when their booking time is nearly over or this meeting room has been booked in next 5 minutes.
\subsection{Integrate with personal devices: }
People can be identified by their personal devices such as mobile phone, laptop.  System can detect the last person who leaves the room by tracking their devices and ask him to turn off the lamp or the heater if they are still on.
\subsection{Information~\cite{survey:2010}}
Smart poster: when users stay near the poster. The phone will show the profile of the author. We can also deploy this system for the computer history museum.\\
