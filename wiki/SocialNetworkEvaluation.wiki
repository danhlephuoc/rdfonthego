#summary RDF On The Go setting up and evaluation.

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains how to set up the RDF On The Go for an Android application and how we did the experiences on that.

=1.Setting up an Android application with RDF OTG=
This new version of RDF OTG provides native RDF storage and Sparql querying engine for Android platform. Thus, all you will need to add into your Android application are just two jar files below:

- <a href='https://rdfonthego.googlecode.com/files/otg_rdf_core.jar'>otg_rdf_core.jar</a> - The native RDF store for Android platform.

- <a href='https://rdfonthego.googlecode.com/files/otg_arq.jar'>otg_arq.jar </a> - The spaql query engine which is ported from Jena ARQ with some modifications in order to pair with RDF OTG.

* Note: Requires Android 2.3.3 or later version and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permisson has to be added in the Android project.
