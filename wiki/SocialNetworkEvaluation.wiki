#summary RDF On The Go setting up and evaluation.

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains how to set up the RDF On The Go for an Android application and how we did the experiences on that.

=1.Setting up an Android application with RDF OTG=
This new version of RDF OTG provides native RDF storage and Sparql querying engine for Android platform. Thus, all you will need to add into your Android application are just two jar files below:

- <a href='https://rdfonthego.googlecode.com/files/otg_rdf_core.jar'>otg_rdf_core.jar</a> - The native RDF store for Android platform.

- <a href='https://rdfonthego.googlecode.com/files/otg_arq.jar'>otg_arq.jar </a> - The spaql query engine which is ported from Jena ARQ with some modifications in order to pair with RDF OTG.

* Note: Requires Android 2.3.3 or later version and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permisson has to be added in the Android project.

==2. Setting up for evaluations==
===2.1 Social network generation===
 For data simulations, we used <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/sibenchmark/'> Social Intelligence Benchmark(SIB) tool</a> which takes the schema style from popular social networks such as Facebook as the baseline for designing an RDF-friendly, scientific benchmark. Specifically, it simulates an RDF backend of a social network site, in which users and their interactions form an social graph of social activities such as writing posts, posting comments, creating/managing groups, etc.
 
The number of users could be change in the parameter file - params.ini. And we also modified name space, the number of friends, the number of photos, posts, comments in order to simulate different network. Example www.facebook.com for facebook, www.linkedin.com for Linkedin, etc. The triples will be save in text file with form of n-tripe.

===2.2 Update throughput evaluation===
===2.3 Comparing query evaluation===
===2.4 Scalability evaluation===
